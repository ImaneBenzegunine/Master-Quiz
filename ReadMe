✅ 1. Create the virtual environment : In your project directory (where your Python files are), run:

python -m venv venv

This creates a virtual environment named venv.

✅ 2. Activate the virtual environment

venv\Scripts\activate


✅ 3. Create the requirements.txt file
Create a requirements.txt file in the same directory with the following contents:


Flask==2.3.2
Flask-SQLAlchemy==3.0.5
Flask-Login==0.6.2
Flask-Cors==4.0.0
Werkzeug==2.3.7
sounddevice==0.4.6
wave
SpeechRecognition==3.10.0
groq==0.10.0
reportlab==4.0.4


⚠️ Note: wave is part of the Python Standard Library, so you don't need to install it — you can remove it from the file or ignore any warning during installation.

✅ 4. Install the requirements
Run the following command:


pip install -r requirements.txt


✅ 5. Run your Flask project
Once all dependencies are installed, you can start your Flask app (assuming it's in a file like app.py) using:


python quiz.py
